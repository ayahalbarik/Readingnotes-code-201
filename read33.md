# HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists.

There are two listsin HTML :
1. order list.
2. unorder list.

** Unordered HTML List **
An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default:

Example
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

** An ordered list **
 starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.

The list items will be marked with numbers by default:

Example
<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>


## boxes 
The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

Explanation of the different parts:

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements. 


Example
Demonstration of the box model:

div {
  width: 300px;
  border: 15px solid green;
  padding: 50px;
  margin: 20px;
}

### basic java instruction

The Java instruction set is the assembly-language equivalent of an Java application. An instruction of the Java instruction set consists of an opcode specifying the operation to be performed, and zero or more operands supplying parameters or data that will be used by the operation. ...
* loop in java *
A loop is a way of repeating lines of code more than once. The block of code contained within the loop will be executed again and again until the condition required by the loop is met. 
For example,
 you could set up a loop to print out the even numbers between 1 and 100.
text += cars[0] + "<br>";
text += cars[1] + "<br>";
text += cars[2] + "<br>";
text += cars[3] + "<br>";
text += cars[4] + "<br>";
text += cars[5] + "<br>";
You can write:
var i;
for (i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
